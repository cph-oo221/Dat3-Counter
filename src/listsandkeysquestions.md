2. Please reflect on the following questions

   2.1 What is the purpose of the key value, which must be given to individual rows in a react-list

   - To identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. If the key is not given for a list, react will just use its index.

     2.2 It's recommended to use a unique value from your data if available (like an ID). How do you get a unique value in a map callback, for data without a unique id?

   - dont understand question?!?!?!

     2.3 What is the difference(s) between state and props?

   - State is internal to a component and is used for managing mutable data that can change over time, while props are external inputs to a component that are passed down from a parent and are immutable within the component.

- 2.4 For which scenarios would you use props, and for which would you use state?
